## [2.6.0] - 2019-01-04
### Potential Breaking Changes:
1. Material UV Transform has been changed from  `Matrix`  to  `UVTransform`  struct. (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
2. Material Texture has been changed from `Stream` to `TextureModel`. This change allows more powerful texture support in future. In most cases, `Stream` will be implicit convert to `TextureModel` to reduce breaking changes. However, it may have issue if you are using XAML binding to a Texture stream in ViewModel. (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
3. `GroupModel3D` and `ItemsModel3D` will no longer support using XAML Children and ItemsSource at the same time (To be consistent with other WPF controls such as ListView).(WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
4. PBR material `RMAMap` property has been renamed and separated into `RoughnessMetallicMap` and `AmbientOcclusionMap`. 
5. `AmbientColor` in InstancingParams has been removed.(WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
6. Remove `Core` namespace on Vector3Collection/Vector2Collection/IntCollection. Base class is changed to `FastList<T>`.

### Added
1. Volume 3D Texture Rendering. [Demo](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit/tree/develop/Source/Examples/WPF.SharpDX/VolumeRendering) is added.  (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
2. Supports [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (using [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET)) for SharpDX.Core. Details refer to [CoreTest demo](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit/tree/develop/Source/Examples/SharpDX.Core/CoreTest).  (WPF.SharpDX and UWP)
3. Supports Line/Point non-fixedSize thickness rendering.  (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
4. Supports SSAO.  (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
5. Adds Assimp Import/Export support for SharpDX versions. (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
6. Demo Winform Integration. [CoreTest demo](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit/tree/develop/Source/Examples/SharpDX.Core/CoreTest)

4. TaskCanceledException not caught in OnDetached #988. (WPF.SharpDX/UWP/Core)
5. ViewCube is acting on Mouse Move #969. (WPF.SharpDX and UWP)
6. LookDirection length in FitView #1009 (WPF)
